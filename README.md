# Chess Game
This is a simple classical chess game implemented in Java. It has a GUI and support an En Passant movement. Moreover there is an AI, which is implemented using a Min-Max algorithm.

## What it does now?
 - It has an AI (implemented with Min-Max algorithm)
 - There are options to choose whether you want to play against other person or computer
 - You can flip the board
 - For now it supports only one special movement - En Passant
 - It has an option to reset the game
 
## Instructions
If you want to select a figure, you should click the left button of mouse onto it first and than choose an empty cell in order to move it. Otherwise you should click the right button of mouse onto it again if you selected it.

## Dependences
 - Java 8
 
 As a first project, I think it is a good game.
